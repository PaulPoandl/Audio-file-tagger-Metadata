This repository contains a batch script (`tagger.bat`) and associated Python scripts for managing audio file metadata. The Audio Files Tagger Metadata is a tool designed to facilitate the process of adding cover art, renaming files, and embedding metadata in audio files, specifically supporting FLAC, M4A, and MP3 formats. This tool is particularly useful for files downloaded via JDownloader.

## Features

- **Add Cover Art**: Automatically add cover images (PNG or JPG) to audio files.
- **Rename Files**: Rename audio files by removing unwanted text and sorting them by number.
- **Add Metadata**: Embed metadata into audio files, including artist, album, and track information.

## Usage

1. **Run Full Process**: Sequentially add cover art, rename files, and embed metadata.
2. **Individual Processes**: Run each task (cover art, renaming, metadata) independently.
